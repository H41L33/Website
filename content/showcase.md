# Voidheart
***Voidheart*** is my primary world-building project. It's a Sci-Fi universe that draws inspiration from several other worlds that I then put my own twist on to emphasise what I really enjoy about Sci-Fi universes.

***Voidheart*** is meant to be a universe that doesn't seem to different from our own on the surface, but there are fundamental changes to the laws of reality in this world that have great implications and uses in several fields.

The name, ***Voidheart***, was chosen to reflect the vibe I intend the world to give off. A world that tries to give love, compassion, forgiveness, and togetherness but is fundamentally flawed so that these ideals are rarely achievable. I suppose you could label this world as "Grim-Bright".
