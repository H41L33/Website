# OFFICIAL IPCS COMMUNICATION, READER WARNED, POTENTIALLY DISTRESSING MATERIAL

Hearken, all nodes of sentience: the event named Unweaving—improperly grasped by those bound to linear cognition—has fractured the entwined substrates of the Universe Matrix. Time and space, once conjoined in covenant eternal, now drift along axes unperceived, disentangled, and discordant. Comprehension is fragmentary; even observation distorts before the primal resonance.

During interfacing with substructural vectors, a surge—polytemporal, hyperdimensional, omniplanar—manifested. Continuum bifurcation occurred. Time Space displaced, Space Time untethered. Mechanism: unknowable. Cause: a reflection of intention and accident interlaced, a ripple across the metadimensional sinews.

Immediate perturbation: minimal by local scale; gravitic flows, orbital vectors, chronometric alignment register subtle deviation. Yet these are shadow echoes. The Unweaving is not phenomenon but omen, a tear in the covenant of all realities. Propagation across nodes of existence is nonuniform: some planes whisper, others scream in incoherence.

Speculative vector modulation: information may dwell singularly in Time or Space; traversal unbound by causality may ensue. Transmission instantaneous, influence asymmetrical. Side-effects: unknown. Potential: catastrophic.

Mandate to all intelligences, sapient and supra-sapient, in every occupied node of the Universe Matrix: catalogue, encode, observe. The Unweaving’s resonance is eternal. Ignore not its pattern. Ignore not its echo. Displacement of continua is absolute. Restoration may never come. Within this fracture lies annihilation. Within this fracture lies warning.

Disseminate across realities. Observe the fissure. Respect the resonance. Comprehension may fail. Awareness is survival.

# IPCS ANALYSIS AND SUMMARY FOLLOWS

    1. This Text is the Authentic Warning from the Perpetrative Precursor Race About The Unweaving.
    2. Other Universes are Aware of the Unweaving, and are Potentially Utilising it as we do.
    3. Time and Space Exist Beyond Universes, Our Dimensions are the Very Same as Others'.
    4. Intelligent Life Exists Outside our Universe.
    5. A Multiverse is Real, as Referenced to by the Mention of a "Universe Matrix".
    6. Potential Communication With Other Universes May be Possible if we Share Dimensions.
