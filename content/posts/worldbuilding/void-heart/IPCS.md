IPCS (Interstellar Precursor Communication Specialists) is a non-profit organization devoted to discovering and decoding any and all forms of communication from the Precursor Race, and other extra-universal actors.

They are entirely made up of volunteers, who have a genuine fascination in these communications.

# Publications Format
All IPCS published communications are wrapped in a header and a footer, the header will usually look something like this:

**OFFICIAL IPCS COMMUNICATION, READER WARNED, POTENTIALLY DISTRESSING MATERIAL**

And the footer will commonly be an analysis and summary section, for those who find understanding the actual text difficult, which is more than understandable.

**IPCS ANALYSIS AND SUMMARY FOLLOWS**
- ***Several Bullet Points...***

# Types of Publication
## Decoded Precursor Race Texts (DPRT)
These are texts from the Precursor Race, those who caused the **Unweaving**.

## Decoded Extrauniversal Communication (DEC)
These are communications from any other extrauniversal actor.

## Outbound Communications Effort (OCE)
These are documents outlining that a communications effort was made to an extrauniversal actor, these will commonly have an extra field in the header which can be any of the following:

- Failed
- Outbound
- Awaiting Response
- Response Received
