# What are Patch Notes ??
Patch Notes are a series of short(er) posts that I'll make every now and then.
I'm not sure whether I'll have these follow a strict structure or just be
freeform yet, so expect some variance.

# Patch Notes for 26/08/2025
I'm getting lots of life stuff sorted out since leaving the RAF, I'm getting
re-enrolled into college tomorrow where I'll be studying:

- Computer Science
- Film Studies
- English Language
- Game Design

Provided these courses have spaces, I am a **VERY** late applicant (term starts
in a week) but there should be space. It's not like these are maddly popular
courses like Maths or anything.

I've got HRT on it's way, provided it doesn't get stopped at customs or
anything. From my last post I mentioned this already, but that's changed since
the pharmacy I purchased from didn't approve of me, and has thus cancelled and
refunded the order.

No matter, I'm getting E vials now and also going the monotherapy route !! Much
better. It is a homebrewed source but the homebrewer I'm using has really good
reviews in the community, and knows what they're talking about. Also really
great customer service !!

I gotta inject this into my butt >~<

Speaking of, I need to go to a clinic that can provide injection supplies free
of charge. There's a few of these clinics in my area, so should be pretty easy.
I might do it while I'm out tomorrow. We'll see. My vial won't get here for a
while yet anyway since it's international.

Also, I setup my tutoring profile for some extra cash to fund my transition.
I'll leave a link [here](https://www.superprof.co.uk/level-student-teaching-computer-science-gcse-level-received-own-gcses-2024.html)
if you're interested. I offer GCSE level computer science tutoring for now.

That's pretty much everything that's happening for now. I'm happy, excited for
the weeks to come, and can't wait to show Hailey to the world !!

As always, thank you so much for reading my silly little rambles <3 You're
amazing, and you are loved.
