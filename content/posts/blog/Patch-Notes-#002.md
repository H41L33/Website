# Patch Notes for 02/09/2025
I'm finishing up my withdrawal from the RAF (actually writing this from the 
base :D), it's a process but I'm getting through it quickly. I've explained to 
them that I've got college starting on the 4th and so they are expediting my 
situation as much as they can, which I am very thankful for.

Speaking of college, there's been a shakeup to my course selection. I was 
initially going to do A-levels, but I'm really not one for academics nor exams. 
I learn by doing, practical work, hence why I chose a BTEC for my engineering 
course and joined the RAF for an apprenticeship. I was advised to opt for 
either BTEC or T-level software development, and after reading what each course 
entails I chose the T-level. T-levels are similar to BTECs, worth 3x A-levels, 
but have even less examination than a BTEC and, also, (this is the big selling 
point for me), industry placement !! During the T-level course, one day per 
week will be spent at an actual company learning how to apply what you've 
learnt in a production environment. Pretty cool if you ask me <3

I got my injection supplies delivered yesterday too !! And I think I may have 
come out to my mum ?? I put "Hailey" on the shipping address and, since I was 
away from home, informed my mum that there's a parcel coming with a freaky name 
on it. She was concerned, and worried, but I told her it's fine and that I'll 
tell her what it's about soon... She accepted the package thankfully but now 
wants a "talk" when I come home :/ I'm not ready to tell her yet !! The 
valerate is still on it's way, I imagine it'll probably arrive on either 
Thursday or Friday.

I've begun work on my skincare routine, I actually ordered stuff to the RAF 
base before I left hoping it would arrive before my week off :/ It didn't, but 
I've got it now that I'm back. It's not too much, and I need some stuff from 
home to finish it off... But here on base I've got a derma scrub, retinol oil, 
and Nivea Q10. I've also got some smelly stuff, I got Sure women's deodorant, 
and this Adidas "Vibes" Fragrance thing (it's like a perfume but not, I don't 
know one of it's kind. Apparently each fragrance creates a different mood using 
science or something 0-0). I like it all, and the Adidas stuff does smell quite 
nice.

That's pretty much everything new, me and my partner are staying in a cabin
soon for her 18th, so that'll be really nice :D Once again, thankyou so much
for reading, believe in yourself, I believe in you <3.
