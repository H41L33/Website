# So Shiny !!
Welcome to my flash new site, that I'll be publishing any of my work on.

This site is powered by Hugo, using the Terminal [theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) by [panr](https://github.com/panr). I make any edits in Obisidian, and Github hosts them with Github Pages.

Some examples of what I'll post here:

- World-Building Entries
- Short Stories
- Personal Blog
- Random Thoughts
