# Who am I?
I'm a student studying game design and creative writing, aiming for a potential career in video game narrative design.

This combines my talent in both of these fields, as from a very young age I've shown interest
in computer programming and software, but I've also always been rather creative and have a
burning passion for writing and/or worldbuilding.

I often find myself inspired by the video games that I play, which are typically narrative-driven
games but not in the usual way. I enjoy games like CIG's *Star Citizen* or Frontier Developments' *Elite: Dangerous*, which are
narrative-driven games where you really feel like you're part of the world since that world feels
genuine, and that it could function without you, the player.

This contrasts to typical narrative-driven action-rpg games for example, where the player almost exclusively drives the plot forward. If I don't play one of these singleplayer games, then when I come back to it the world will be exactly how I left it. If I go a few months without playing those aforementioned games, then the world has usually completely shifted into a new storyline that I now need to go and be a part of.

# Why Make This Site?
I made this site as to publish my works independently, and without depending on a third-party platform. This lets me publish as and when I want to, and to present my work as I see fit. Additionally, it gets me much closer to my readers, and I can tailor the reading experience purely based on their feedback.
